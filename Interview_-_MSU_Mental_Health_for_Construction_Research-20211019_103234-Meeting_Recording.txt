Interviewer:  so these questions wait until it so these questions are relate to sort of aspects of your work environment and the first is looking at positive aspects of your work environment what makes you feel valued and or supported at work
Participant:  I think my self accomplishment is my number one like when I can look what I saw like look what I did today that's kind of the biggest positive is my own accomplishment and then you know the other stuff is generally related to who are you paired up with and what and how is the job site progressing you know you could be on a a good job site where everybody's all happy and everything smooth as silk and then you can go to a job site where it's a disaster and materials are late or somebody did something wrong or you have a terrible owner it's just there's so many unreliable factors like daily it's so changing so the one constant positive is you can always go back and just say hey I did that today are I accomplish that today so I'd have to go with that one
Interviewer:  okay good let's look at some challenging aspects you sort of alluded to that of your work environment what parts of your work cause you stress
Participant:  mainly other people having to deal with other personalities and verbiage that might come out of their mouth you know it's kind of a rough and tough field you can't really be emotional you gotta kind of keep your personal emotions separate and realize it's work versus you so you can get a contractor Madge over a circumstance but he could take it out on you or you could you know just work with a guy and he could just be a dick so I would say the most challenging part is those personalities as far as getting along with people and then also the work you know not everybody does the same quality of work hm people might not interpret something the same way you might want to argue about you know how you're going to do it procedure wise and there's more than one way to skin a cat but when you have all these personalities going at it I would say that that's the month challenging
Interviewer:  thing and then that probably makes sense why the positive aspect is you looking at what you've done there's too many other factors
Participant:  that you can really rely on on a day-to-day basis like I've been on job sites where my project manager has been amazing and I'm like oh I love my job and I've been like on a 5 month stretch where work was just amazing and I was happy it wasn't really stressed free but that's really minimal in this field it's a very high-stress job it's it's just is I mean things don't show up there's multiple problems from multiple different Avenues it's so multifaceted I don't really think there's any one thing that you can try to narrow it down to it just depends on the day
Interviewer:  how long have you been doing this I'm going on twelve
Participant:  years so I started through the apprenticeship I was actually in the field I'm in a journeyman union carpenter and then I had a wrist injury we're dead I actually lost my wrist so I switched over to Rockford which is construction management which is totally different Avenue of of dealing with things it's a different job it's off you know instead of me going and physically just showing up and building something with my hands I'm now managing the guys that do everything that I used to do but now you deal with owners and you deal with Architects and you you know there's so many more things to deal with than just the trade contractors
Interviewer:  right wow very like you said a lot of variables and that does sound challenging have you been deal would you say you've been feeling stressed absolutely I feel like
Participant:  I got grey hair very early I feel like a lot of my forehead wrinkles that I cover up through my bangs I it's a very it's the most stressful job I've ever had in my life it's there's no way that you could Define this as a low-stress job there is just isn't there's not one single day that goes by where you don't have some type of stress in one way shape or form and it's usually multiple stressors it's not usually just one or two it's like oh what what kind of ships hitting the fan this hour of today or they you know there's just so we made it to lunch with no issues
Interviewer:  you just
Participant:  kind of gotta try to like humor eyes it a little bit to take some of that stress off it's just like well if it's not one thing it's going to be another but then try to add the positive aspect of if there wasn't problems then I wouldn't have a job cuz that's kind of what I'm here
Interviewer:  for so you sort of like the problem solver
Participant:  as yeah like we do so basically the the owner will hire us to do their job and then we would go ahead and hire all the trade contractors and oversee the projects so we're kind of the construction management side so I would be like different roles like right now I must testing project manager on six different projects out of a Job trailer office you know and there's just a lot going on and I knew to it so I'm learning things that I don't know and that part is exciting but stressful and frustrating you know but then you have the other side where I'm just like a site superintendent so I would actually not be doing much paperwork I would be on site making sure that they're following safety making sure that they're building things per drawings you know there there's just a huge check list of responsibilities and lots of different roles in which you can log
Interviewer:  fit
Participant:  in I change a lot which is probably good for me it says a lot for me that they can kind of stick me anywhere I could go on an education job I could go on a multi-family unit job I could go on a Meijer retail store job so that's good for me that I'm multi-faceted enough where they can kind of switch me around and I don't get stuck into me that mundane I'm doing the same thing every job over and over and over and over again which can be a downfall to a lot of the guys just get sick of it but that's why they get really good and that's why it's considered a specialty you know if I want to get a roof done I'm going to call a roofer not a plumber right you know so it's it's part that goes with the job but it can be mundane at times when you get sick doing the same thing over and over right
Interviewer:  what are you currently do to manage your stress um we like how you might manifest they like sleep right now
Participant:  I just came off of the summer and the summer during the school like in a school project where the kids are on vacation you know it's like Mad Dash of Summer working sixty seventy hours a week and the weekends to
Interviewer:  it it's it's stressful cuz
Participant:  you usually have to drive far you have to drive to where the job sites are so you don't just have eight or ten hour shift you have eight or ten hour shift on top of a two and half to three hour drive if you want to add to work and from
Interviewer:  work so I mean I I'm exhausted you know like
Participant:  luckily my daughter turned eighteen now so I can just be like oh you're on your own for dinner or she won't even be home cuz she'll be at work so that's actually that not have a responsibility of having the younger child at home anymore was changed things for me dramatically because I don't have to come home and feel obligated to cook dinner after my long
Interviewer:  day but it it off struggled to try to find any kind of
Participant:  personal time or find a healthy coping mechanisms I would say like I eat or sleep would probably be how I would go with that honestly
Interviewer:  which isn't good the sleep is but sometimes
Participant:  unless you sleep for like fourteen hours which I never get to
Interviewer:  do do you would you say that that is what you do to managing both mentally mental stress and physical stress yeah
Participant:  I I just sometimes they mesh together and you can't even you can't even decipher between the two like I would answer that differently like home when I used to work in the trades cuz I built cold storage buildings so physically I was so exhausted when I came home like there were times where I sat on the couch and fell asleep sitting up in my dirty work clothes left my work boots on Thursday cuz you're just exhausted you skip dinner you skip a shower you just wake up at 3 in the morning like oh wow I guess I can shower and get clean clothes on and get to go do it all over again on this side of it with the construction management it's a little different stress it's not it's more mental Than Physical I mean there isn't a physical part of my job anymore other than me being where I need to be at what time he's here the the mental stress of this is a lot greater
Interviewer:  there's a lot more
Participant:  responsibilities there's you know a lot more fine attention to detail and then the other part of it is you know coming from the trades into management there's a lot more paperwork a computer work and I've had to fill in for like administrative responsibilities because we don't have one and I have no idea what the hell I'm doing so I have like six hundred emails like file this file this and I'm just like even know what this is that I'm looking at where do you want me to put it you know so it's a different depending on where you work in construction you're going to have a wage even scale on whether it's physical or or mental I think one that gets left out a lot as emotional stress yeah I don't think that that's accounted for young people actually look at the industry is the emotional part which is huge because of the self-sacrifice that you make for your family to do this type of job
Interviewer:  right and and because you're the first female I've had to interview I that's different yeah that's awesome I set that that's very different in how to manage the emotional side versus for you versus maybe a man yeah and it
Participant:  will the men don't even realize that their emotional they just snapped out and then they are very quick to say well you're a female your emotions and it's like the females that actually get into this trade or probably less emotional than men that you know you have to have a thick skin to be here you
Interviewer:  know I I've been
Participant:  made cry before and my boss was like I know you're not crying you better not let anybody see you cry not in a mean way but just like you know pull your big girl panties up and don't let that guy off you know get into your head because they will be me there mean I mean people in general are mean but you know you come across some guys that are just I mean I I was like dead a second-year Apprentice then I got told bitch what are you even doing here you should be at home barefoot and pregnant and then you know I'll go some be like hey sunshine like why do you feel the need to you know call me Sunshine okay you just gotta take like if you take it personally your good not
Interviewer:  make it right so there's kind
Participant:  of you kind of gotta turn off your emotions which I don't know is is a healthy thing to
Interviewer:  do right but you're not going to make it if you do if you don't get that fixed skin and be able to
Participant:  separate that emotional stuff you're not going to make it in this
Interviewer:  industry it's
Participant:  not for the weak of
Interviewer:  heart right well Missy if you could develop a way to address stress in the workplace and and this is sort of like thinking outside the box and you could address it in money and Leadership by n was not an issue okay it looked like a I would definitely think
Participant:  that the the demand would need to come down as far as like the hours in the not caring about the personal life like thoughts about income and deadlines which I get it but you could pay more people to work Less hours to take some of the stress off I think that long drive time should be considered or taken into consideration to the shift and that's never looked at so you know they're expecting work ten twelve hour shifts and they don't care if you have to drive three hours there and back so add that and then I just don't think that they give people any time to re collect themselves I mean
Interviewer:  I
Participant:  worked for a contractor one time that worked for tens and that's all he would work because he wanted his guys to have a three-day weekend and he said bust your ass for me for 4 days and I'm going to give you those three days off and that contractor had the happiest crew ever because he considered the effects that they had families at home and they you know that was the Compromise you give them these hard-working four days I'm going to give you that three days of relaxation so he worked us Monday through Thursday and it was amazing because your most companies are going to work you Friday and they're going to work you sat down and they don't they can give two shits less if you got a kid or a dog or a vacation or anything they don't really care
Interviewer:  so if it was
Participant:  unlimited money I would think that I would add more than the workforce to give back to the dedication that is given by people that work in the trait it used to be back in the day you know you could retire at home you too and that's why the construction industry boomed so much because you could go put in a hard you know a hard career but you could retired enough time to enjoy your money and enjoy your family or enjoy your grandkids and they keep pushing it up to like 65 who wants to come break their backs their whole lives and now you gotta work til sixty-five that's why people aren't getting into it anymore they're they're not making it a lucrative
Interviewer:  Choice it's just hard back-breaking labor yes
Participant:  it's a skilled trade yes there's a lot of positive and feel good that comes from oh I built that we all seem to run around and be like oh you see that building I built that you know you know how we do that we like oh I did that one too so yes that excitement comes in but does it outweigh what you're actually sacrificing of your personal life to choose to do this
Interviewer:  job and
Participant:  I just don't think that the higher-ups could care really about you know you get some companies I'm not going to say Not Dead nobody cares but the vast majority is just like well if you won't do it somebody else will if you don't want to work those hours somebody else will you know it's
Interviewer:  it's kind of cut through right yeah and you do see the companies that set tend to flourish or the ones that take care of their people well
Participant:  people will work harder for you if you take care of them nobody wants to feel like they aren't off a real person and they're just a number like I don't want to be employee number 372 you know I I have a name I have a family I have a personality I have things in the companies that choose to acknowledge that and the companies that
Interviewer:  choose to take good care of their employees are the ones that keep the guys
Participant:  around for years and years and years and they do well and flourish
Interviewer:  because they need those experienced
Participant:  guys instead of having that our attrition over them keep moving in and out in and out you have to
Interviewer:  retrain them you know
Participant:  lots of guys will get with a partner they've been working with them side-by-side for twenty-five thirty
Interviewer:  years that makes a huge difference than the
Participant:  productivity of those people versus two random people that you
Interviewer:  just hired and you
Participant:  get another one every three months because nobody's going to stick around I get treated
Interviewer:  like shit right do you have any other recommendations thoughts concerns anything you want to share I just think that you know the
Participant:  construction industry that is slightly slower kind of had like that good old boy mentality you know so they didn't want to learn look at you know diversity or inclusion of or anything it was just kind of like the white man's thing I mean it really was and now you're getting minorities you're getting women you're getting lots of different things and not everybody is open to that so it's kind of an old-school I feel like we're kind of a dinosaur we're kind of behind you know the curb a little bit where the world is going with that inclusion and believe it or not I I get it still on a pretty weekly basis I still deal with some type of because I'm a female
Interviewer:  type situation so you know
Participant:  you can't expect everybody to be on board but I think companies do need to do a better job of you know including and making sure that they're diverse and then also following up with their employees you know there's lots of times where people would be scared to say something or scared to complain because they're not going to do anything about it I actually started a union group called sisters in the Brotherhood and it's basically just all women it's through the union it's just for support for emotional mental like if you need somebody to call me that understands because a lot of women you know we can talk to you but if you've never been in our shoes you don't really get it so we started that group with encouragement from the union and the union supported It Off
Interviewer:  was just to create it
Participant:  but then they fell off so it's like okay we created it we can say that we have it now but then they don't put anything wouldn't give any funding to it they wouldn't put any money into it so you know we kind of feel like it's it's like a show like everybody's looking so we're going to tell you that we have This Woman's Group or we can tell you our numbers that we have this many percentage of minorities or women in you know it's unfortunate that it's more for show than I think it is for care yeah and now I will say that Rockford is an amazing company as far as the work culture they're very very supportive they do try to stay on top of the curve so I can't really include Rockford but I worked for other companies previous to record in Rockford is very unique in that way they hold a very high standard they do things a lot differently they have that personal bowl like we care about you you know they even give you a job free family vacation day once a year just to say hey take this family day whenever you need it and just those little itty bitty things even if it's only one day a year the fact that you even consider the fact that your employees might just need a family day it's just a huge point I guess to show what they're trying to do you know they have committees they have meetings they asked questions and off and I do appreciate that and no change is going to be implemented overnight but you know I think I think mental and emotional health are still
Interviewer:  very not talked about
Participant:  I think people don't feel comfortable or they feel like they're going to be judged and my only other job that I ever did was customer service in waitressing so you may I am familiar with how people cope with stress and it's the same in the trades you know I I work side-by-side the guys have the shakes you can tell that they're drinkers you can smell the alcohol on them within that it's sad that that's how they have to self-medicate to do it it's even more scarier because we're on site and these are the guys that are like operating cranes and driving big equipment and you don't say you want the yeah they pass their drug test and yeah you know they get their job but nobody cares about how they feel at the end of the day nobody cares about how tired they are nobody cares that they've worked for two days straight with no
Interviewer:  time off nobody cares so that's just kind of there's there's just a
Participant:  stigma don't complain be a hard-ass in don't show any emotion and that's the stigma and if you want to complain nobody's going to want to work with you and don't complain about you
Interviewer:  complaining you
Participant:  know you can't really speak up for yourself and expect anything to get done cuz they're just going to look at you like a trying to start problems it's it's looked at more of a if you speak up it's looked at as more of a problem than it is oh I'm going to listen to you and try to do something to rectify it
Interviewer:  and that's just kind of
Participant:  like a that old school if you don't like it get lost kind of mentality and that's really the way it is like there's always going to be somebody to replace you that's the way that they feel and that's the way that it's kind of treated across the board and then you can't really be you you can't be emotional you can't just say hey I need a day I'm going to have a breakdown you can't like so I don't know if you see my question here or not but I had to answer that one honestly so I found out like a month ago that my boyfriend of four years and my best friend had been sleeping together behind my back I have no like thing that I could say at work like I'm just supposed to show up and be like yeah can I get a mental health day or can I get an emotional health day like I went to change an appointment and my doctor really was like do you need to be taken off of work you know just because I always answer questions honestly and she's like well and I'm like it's just circumstantial like you did not commit me or anything I'm just saying like right now what I'm going through in my personal life I don't even have time to deal with it yeah
Interviewer:  so it was like I had this big betrayal so
Participant:  I'm like okay I tried to deal with the best friend part first and then I got like two or three weeks into that and now it's like oh I still have a whole boyfriend part that I got a deal with and it just there isn't any time or any room so what happens like in this particular example I'm giving you is that we just now have to push our personal feelings under the rug because there's a job to do but then you take work home because you're you're driving home and you're like oh I forgot to send this guy an email or I need to get this quote from this contractor and send this over to the architects of your mind like going going going and then when you finally sit down and stop it's like a hit you so hard all at once you don't even want to deal with it so you're like oh we're going to go to bed or I'm going to have a drink
Interviewer:  or you just don't have you don't
Participant:  really get a personal life when you get this job and there there's not a consideration or care whether you do or you don't it's just kind of like a Flippin ass attitude is the best fan not
Interviewer:  explain it let me see I really hope you're able to get at least a way to grieve the loss and in just the whole like you said betrayal because at some point you'll you'll you know it sounds like you're compartmentalizing right now yeah and that's the point
Participant:  that's what I'm saying that's what we have to do I
Interviewer:  know yeah but I sure do appreciate you you know being so candid and and sharing as much as you did and I I hope that you have time at some point to say I do have to take care of me off a Sundays yes so try to do some self care okay okay it's been a pleasure and kudos to you you know what you you rock thank you you do and just consider yourself you know this is awesome to see a woman who is in a position where most men are at and and you stuck it out for twelve years that's
Participant:  a long ride in it it's not been easy but it's I do take pride in it and nobody can take it away from me so it's an urn thing you gotta earn me you go up the ladder so I just figure if I'm just a girl 10 by the time I get up here you can't take it away from
Interviewer:  me right and that that Sisterhood group even if it's not being supported in any way I think the fact that you've started it it it is a possibility it does help and support other women I think that you know that's what we're here for I think is to to be an advocate for each other right well we do have a Facebook
Participant:  group so I you know we add all women's just strictly from the trades and it's really just vent and advice and that's kind of what it's turned into so it's still active it's you know people you see the women talking it makes me proud to see them have an outlet or to ask advice from another woman you know there's lots of locals like when I went in there was I was only one or two women in the entire local so you know you don't always have a plenty of women that they're the only woman so they have nobody to go to and then you know you're already up against the odds because nine times out of ten they don't want either right so like I said well I'll walk around here
Interviewer:  well you're doing a great job thank you Dawn and I appreciate your time today to my pleasure thank you for help yes definitely all right take care you too bye-bye
