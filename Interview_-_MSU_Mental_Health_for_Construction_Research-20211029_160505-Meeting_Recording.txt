Interviewer:  talking with my hands most of the time so if we think about the positive aspects of your work environment what makes you feel the most valued and supported at work I guess just
Participant:  this the the sense that you're helping out other team members get their projects done
Interviewer:  okay anything else that even is a positive aspect of your work environment well I guess I mean as far as I
Participant:  mean I don't know the question is a little odd I guess I just you know that's that's one of the things I I guess I take away from work the most is you know that's part of what my job is I guess is to help the the site teams have successful projects so, if I get the impression from them from things that they say or the way we interact with each other that that I'm accomplishing that than that gives me you know a pretty good feeling about you know that I'm doing my
Interviewer:  job right okay
Participant:  you know I can get a paycheck any place
Interviewer:  exactly did you say you've been in this management role for a while I've been in this management
Participant:  role with Rockford construction for about four years as a in a kind of a general opposition in helping out the other the sites dead but from a construction standpoint I've been in some you know either as a foreman or a superintendent some type of management position for most wage
Interviewer:  career are there any challenging aspects of your career you know even just where you're at anything that causes
Participant:  stress yeah the the workload can be a little overwhelming at times trying to keep up with everything construction can handle you know a lot of things can just kind of pop up you know in the choice of a day how do we build this how does you know where is this supposed to go does this look right and those things kind of interfere with some of the things you might have already on your agenda for the day. I need to start looking at planning for you know this upcoming project so I need to sit down and you know concentrate on one thing for a while and sometimes that is difficult to do it's maintaining Focus because of unexpected interruptions sometimes can you know or or maintaining you know keeping up with things sometimes be off of unexpected interruptions so that can that adds a little stress to the job how did it affect the job you know for us we I work with Rockford construction I work within our Meijer department so we're building grocery stores and somehow that fell within the realm of what what do they call it the essential wage yes so even though we were building grocery stores not working at an open grocery store that needed to maintain you know product for customers you know we were still working we were still building our projects and I was still traveling I was driving around for a period of time during you know when when some of the states and cities were having lockdowns that you weren't supposed to be traveling I was driving around with you know several different letters explaining that I should be a considered an essential worker should anybody ever question that so dead things really did not slow down for me at all during the during the the height of you know kind of those lockdowns and things during the
Interviewer:  covin okay. Well that's good it is it did it you know from
Participant:  that standpoint though also I am not a how do I put it I'm not a covid-19
Interviewer:  I
Participant:  don't I don't believe it was a hoax or anything of that nature so there was a certain amount of stress in being out in about you know in those public settings still you know worrying about you know my health or my family's health in you know even though I live alone now you know I did I took a point A lot of times because I'm out and about I was out and about still working you know I went a long stretch without stopping by and visiting you know my older parents because I was worried about you know potentially you know causing harm inadvertantly but
Interviewer:  right did you did you notice any change in like the amount of workers did you you know if a few workers get ill or if one person does it impact it can impact the entire team
Participant:  sure you know we did have that we did have individual projects that had to shut down for periods of time you know because somebody would test positive and wage and then other people would have to go get tested in until their test results came back they would have to stay away from work I know early on in the pandemic off first lock down kind of started happening we were actually working on a project up in Bad Axe Michigan and one of the one worker from one company was sent home with c e comes and came back and had tested positive so with the whole job shut down for like two weeks we we had to have served Pro come out and disinfect the entire building you know looking back on it now it was it would be considered an over reaction to this at this point if somebody tested positive you know we don't react quite the same way as we did you know in those first months when the lockdowns were you know kind of real serious right but so yes there were instances there where there were disruptions to our workplace off due to you know people testing positive for it so and you know that's you know that goes back to the you know things happen and you have to react to them and it interferes with what with what you may have already had on your schedule to get done
Interviewer:  so is it relates to stress do you have any particular stressors from work is their ways that you manage stress off
Participant:  I don't know that I give it a lot of conscious thought and how I'm necessarily managing stress
Interviewer:  you
Participant:  know other than you know basically I just you know I get to the end of a long day and I kind of get to the point where I feel like yeah I've had about enough then I know it's just kind of time to start shutting down for the day
Interviewer:  sure you know
Participant:  and trying to and I've always been this way even back when I was more working in the trades as opposed to in a management situation but you know I've always kind of been one too to some extent be able to finish the end of the day take the work boots off and you know now I'm kind of trying to be done thinking about work so I'm not that there are times where you know you wake up in the morning your mind's already going a thousand miles a minute because so many things are just jumping that you need to get done but you know if you can finish off of your day and you know find a way to you know be able to walk away from it and you know get it off your mind for a few hours that's usually
Interviewer:  helpful. Is there anything specifically that you do to manage stress both physically and mentally
Participant:  again I don't know that I'd give it a lot of conscious thought as far as that goes that you know that hey I need to manage my stress today but you know I mean and I am fortunately I apologize I've been talked to before about smoking while I'm on these type of meetings so I I am I do smoke cigarettes and I know that's you know kind of a you know a bit of a long way to manage stress up not really healthy way to manage stress obviously but it is a way and you know how long the occasional you know get to the weekends some people you know drink a few beers just relax over the weekend things of that nature you know it's kind of just find a way to
Interviewer:  relax okay now Gary I thought you were just adding some sort of smoky Ambience I know
Participant:  right yeah
Interviewer:  Sunset home so really my last question is it relates to what you might recommend if if you had the ability to recommend something to leadership off if there was a way to develop strategies to address stress in the workplace and Leadership by in money wasn't an issue and you knew it could not fail what would it look like you know I think a lot
Participant:  of times and I don't know if it's really necessarily specific to the construction industry or not but finding a way to to try to let people have you know while still maintaining the ability to complete projects in a in a in a you know in an adequate way right off people it's it's sometimes it's hard to maintain a reasonable and I hate the term but I'm going to use it anyway because it's very descriptive is that work-life balance yes ma'am it's hard to do that when sometimes you know you get to the end of a job and you find that oh for a couple of weeks I'm going to have to work weekends wage to get this job across the Finish Line on time or I'm going to have to work a few hours this evening and you know that can cause a lot of stress within a you know family atmosphere so I see that even with some of the younger guys that I work with is that you know will be at work and we'll be talking and they'll be like hey yeah my wife's not real happy with me right now I've worked last three weekends you know or you know I've you know they you know my wife just doesn't feel like I'm giving you know enough attention to the family because I'm working so much and off that can be just because they're on a job that's requiring them to do a lot of hours trying to get the job across the finish line or it can be because they're out of town working on a project that's a you know a travel job in a fairly home so here they are working out of town Monday through Friday and they get home and you know Saturday and Sunday they still still spend a couple hours in front of their computer trying to catch up on emails so long I guess a lot of times I my my thought is simply that well every business needs to make money to be successful and make a profit to be successful sometimes I'm trying to figure out how to maybe put additional Manpower on jobs so that the guys that are working are not having to put in so much of their time that it is affecting their away from work time in a negative
Interviewer:  manner you're not the first person to mention that so and like I said I don't think that I don't think that's I don't want to say that as if it's a
Participant:  it's it's not a it's not specific to Rockford construction it's not specific to even the construction industry as a whole I think you can find that in a lot of other places that work on a moral especially especially businesses that work on more of a project-by-project basis than necessarily A open 9 to 5 or in certain hours for business type of situation right no we're working we may be salaried but we're working hours to get a job done not necessarily always a set prescribed amount of hours
Interviewer:  right yeah makes sense I hear what you're saying is I probably have my computer on 7 days a week yep yep easily okay do you have anything that you want to add, or any of the well I mean I will say this I know that you
Participant:  know there are times when you know some of the workload like I said can get a little overwhelming I did you know through our healthcare system through Priority Health there are there you know options available you know and and these you know any more than the the mental health aspect of things is a lot more front and center than it may have been you know twenty years ago that they conversation of mental health than it used to be so I did take advantage of it of a a program through Priority Health to to look into I'm doing some counseling I did a few sessions I just didn't really feel that it was necessarily working for me so I did not dead like with it I think you know just taking the step of even pursuing that maybe put it more front and center in my own life and that I needed to do a better job of you know at the end of the day you know put it down walk away find a way to disconnect from whatever you're stressing about you know even if that's just you know sitting down and watching TV or reading a book or whatever or just doing you know busy tasks around the house but you know finding a way to get those things out of your mind and what being able to get away from it for a while is pretty important
Interviewer:  so good I'm glad that that was even though the the full counseling wasn't it was beneficial to take away from it was yeah yep well Gary I thank you very much for your time I am sorry that my camera does not work I like having conversations where people can see me yes boss feel like you're talking to somebody and you can't see them it's makes a little bit more difficult but your time I know is very valuable I appreciate it I appreciate your willingness to answer some of these questions and just give your perspective yep
Participant:  no problem no problem will there be any follow-up be on this Dawn
Interviewer:  or some I were working on putting together an analysis from the survey as well as the interviews and providing some feedback to all the companies that have put this out there to their employees about participating so we'll definitely provide some overall feedback and that's why I wanted to make sure that there was a question as it related to Thursday at the end of the day what would be helpful for leadership to know because it is important we're seeing such higher numbers wage depression and anxiety and and suicide rates as well as you know substance use disorders and so it needs to be needs to be addressed it needs to be something that all organizations take seriously because their biggest asset are their employees yeah and without you all dead they can't really do a whole lot so right
Participant:  well and it's yeah it's not twenty or thirty years ago anymore so you can't just tell people to suck it up that's front you know that attitude now frowned upon you know that's what my father would tell me to do so
Interviewer:  yes definitely so
Participant:  okay well I don't know are we all set here then we are and I hope you enjoy your Friday and I hope you can just shut it off when you're ready to leave oh yep not a problem just really this weekend looking forward to watching Michigan kick Michigan State's but
Interviewer:  well because you're wearing the you know the U of
