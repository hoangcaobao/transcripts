Interviewer:  unstructured questions and there's no right or wrong answer the first will look at sort of positive aspects of your work environment so what makes you feel valued or supported even at work or what is a positive aspect at work
Participant:  I like positive feedback I guess I like negative feedback to any kind of feedback is good so you kind of know where you stand we kind of operate with the understanding of no news is good news so yeah we always get told that we're doing our job we're doing a good job so that's I guess it's pretty much it
Interviewer:  is there anything that besides the the feedback whether it's positive or negative anything else that you would say really makes it feel like it's a positive work environment I
Participant:  mean I definitely like the people Rockford has a really great people we promote family so I've been around 16,000 years so that's always been a big draw for me I like the the family culture of it even though we're getting to be a very big company they still are very mindful of that and try and maintain that so that's something I always really liked that's a
Interviewer:  positive hey it seems like most people that I've interviewed with Rockford enjoy the
Participant:  company yes you know. It's it's a great company yeah
Interviewer:  but you know are there any challenging aspects of your work
Participant:  environment there's not much that isn't challenging we obviously are dealing with subcontractors we're dealing with owners and clients a lot everybody has their own expectations so it's it's definitely challenging your managing people so when you're you know dealing with subcontractors you have a schedule to keep but at the same time you you can't force people to do their jobs you can't force them to show up so that's always definitely a big
Interviewer:  challenge are there any things that and particularly cause you stress people
Participant:  people cause me stress yeah other than that I love building I love the construction of it I love the details off you know I really like that I just people is probably the biggest
Interviewer:  challenge did you use to have a trade that you did prior to taking this supervisory
Participant:  role yeah I was a carpenter for about five years okay
Interviewer:  there you didn't have to deal with people as much correct
Participant:  yeah there you just kind of show up and you do your job you know you can work hard and if you're getting your job done you know you did a good job to wear with what I do everybody's job and what they do affects what I do so if they fail I fail no matter how hard I work so that's that's definitely a frustrating challenging aspect
Interviewer:  what are some things that you do to manage your stress
Participant:  hang on to my wife a lot yeah her and I are best friends and that's really what we do is you know we kind of go on an adventure we like the outdoors I just love spending time together so that's pretty much my major stress relief is just spending time with my
Interviewer:  wife are there anything any things you've done to maybe to modify your lifestyle to help with besides you know spending time with your wife whether it's like exercise or anything like that
Participant:  not made sure I don't like necessarily exercise or workout I'm pretty fit as it is I'm blessed with a very fast metabolism so as far as that goes I mean we go on walks we often but as far as exercise that's probably the extent of it she is very big into working out and that kind of stuff yeah other than that I mean just learning I guess how to let things go at the end of the day knowing that there's there's only so much I can control from my to see as much as I want to and I might be responsible for it there's so much I can control so I guess it's just it's learning as you get older on how to deal with that I
Interviewer:  guess are there any tips that you could share like how you might learn to let go or what have you done to help you learn you know let go of that stress
Participant:  I'm still navigating that really to be honest I'm still learning that I'm doing a lot better now but I had some pretty rough years two or three years ago even to the point where I didn't want to work in construction anymore because I was getting so frustrated with them yeah I'm still trying to figure out how to navigate that and that's I guess part of why I chose to take part of this interview I mean a lot better position where I am today but I understand the wrong Mental Health Challenge of things and I was in Pursuit pretty dark places you know two or three years ago so I am very
Interviewer:  mindful but you know it's good that you are definitely passed that or if in a different place than you were that's scary to be in in a dark place and how long it'll health is a real priority and it always is but it seems to be more so at the you know at the Forefront now especially with pandemic yep and that's just we ask questions that hopefully don't elicit too many negative thoughts and feelings but anxiety and depression are very real and you know we're looking to see what are people doing to help not go in that dark place and what are some resources that are available to you at least know that you have resources available to you and those that you work with do you have anything else to add to that
Participant:  and then I mean it all basically comes down to my faith I mean my faith is my Foundation that's what keeps me solid and moving forward without them I would not be where I am today so I was very fortunate that I you know I grew up with that kind of foundation and then I chose to continue to pursue that relationship in that belief and that's definitely helped me that's where I always have to kind of go back to get grounded again
Interviewer:  and it sounds like you've got a partner who is in the same headspace and he does a lot to help you with you know keeping you active keeping your you know you in a positive frame as well
Participant:  very much yeah that's
Interviewer:  wonderful the last question is sort of in relation to a recommendation to managing stress if you could develop a way to address stress especially in a workplace choice and money and Leadership by in was not an issue look at look like
Participant:  it's an interesting question if I have an answer for you on that one right off the top of the bat I don't know what I would
Interviewer:  do I think companies are thinking about this we're seeing a lot more organizations and institutions like even hiring like a achieve Wellness officer I mean to the point where it's being looked at in all in most major companies and in some companies media charges astute to it but I think just knowing that you know what there are stressors that your employees have and what are some things that we can do as an organization to help them so
Participant:  yeah I mean I definitely like where our leadership's going I mean we just had an all-staff last week in one of the biggest messages that came out of that was our most important asset is you guys as our team it's not our clients it's not the jobs as you guys in it's good to hear that the leadership is focusing on that again because they're dead without us they don't have clients and they don't have the business that they have and so for them to kind of change their focus of you guys are our most important part of this company it's it's good to hear that and know that they were thinking about it
Interviewer:  well that's good it shows that they're they're making some strides as well to help you all feel valued and you are their biggest asset so that's good okay well you know it's sort of one of those if you knew you could you could suggest something that wouldn't fail you know what would you do but it's it's a hard
Participant:  question it is a hard question yeah
Interviewer:  what it sounds like you you get some value-add in a lot of self-worth from your job and you're you are getting positive feedback and you do have a way to manage stress when you go home you have anything else that you want to add to this I don't think so but Shake I really appreciate your time this morning. And I hope you have a good day and thank you very much yeah you're welcome you have a great day as well thank you and blessings to
