Interviewer:  so it should be recording so the first question is it relates to positive aspects of your work environment positive yeah, so what makes you feel valued and or supported at
Participant:  work I guess I feel valued and supported don't trust me to be here and pretty much by myself and do the job and they're not constantly hounding me and micromanage me and things like that
Interviewer:  it sounds like more autonomy and Independence yeah anything else that you value
Participant:  I feel like they value me and trust me again with the type of project that I'm on you know I'm not just on some little project that doesn't mean anything this one's with my experience it's a pretty high-profile job with my minimal experience now think
Interviewer:  about challenging aspects of your work environment are there any parts of your work that cause you stress a little bit
Participant:  I've done with them I've been in this field for four years now and I'll say the first two didn't really count because I was on a project it was just different wage um it was more of Hurricane Relief sought was Tarpon windows and roofs and things like that so it wasn't really building buildings at the time my changes then just trying to figure out the trade and you know there's help out there within the company you know you just gotta know who to ask trying to find the right person and get a hold of them when you need them you know cuz sometimes you need help right now and you can't always get the help right then so but there's enough resources out there you know with the internet YouTube things like that you can got some common sense you could Fairmont still follow yeah we're just managers were not the the trades actually doing the work and happen to be licensed all this stuff so management people you know that can be a little stressful sometimes not so much on this job because it's just getting started but you know you got everybody else's personalities that you gotta learn to deal with and figure out what works best with them you know so you don't set them off construction can get kind of tough at times when you're behind schedule
Interviewer:  any other challenges or stress that's
Participant:  work-related right now that's probably the same as what everybody else is dealing with wage would be materials getting materials here and the workforce you know ramping now I don't want to say we're on track cuz we're not but we're close to being on track but if we have one little hiccup with Colby the wheels are coming off the
Interviewer:  bus if you see you're the first person who's mentioned and it's a pretty big deal or is a huge issue and this applies not being available and pause
Participant:  yeah it's definitely affected sure s
Interviewer:  and speaking of a pandemic maybe know that it is caused a lot of increased stress but you feel like you've been feeling stressed I don't think
Participant:  so kind of laid-back
Interviewer:  it's probably good in your line of work yeah if when you do have stress you know whether it's physically mentally how do we manage with that you know how do you manage or cope with stress
Participant:  well kind of try to figure out what I control can control what I can control and that's something I can control figure out a way to do it make it work that's out of my control you know I still look at it try to figure out another Avenue to take off get around
Interviewer:  us with being laid back and are there things that you do where you feel maybe you don't feel like you need to is there anything that just for in general to help keep you balanced that you do to sort of Hope or just managed well to to manage and balance your life
Participant:  mean like at
Interviewer:  home or just sort of you know from a health like a well-being perspective how do you
Participant:  mean I don't know
Interviewer:  like some people will exercise some people will it changed their diet I
Participant:  well I do woodworking a home and that that's my happy place you know if something is bugging me I'll just go up there and Tinker around with that that's I'll save well motorcycling will be kind of a stress reliever too if I am feeling all stress cuz I don't have to worry about anything other cars trying to
Interviewer:  run you over right now he's working sounds good that's a good distraction and it's if it's creative it's you know it's utilizing all aspects of your brain and it's just probably a really good technique for stress reduction and you enjoy it but this is the last question and it relates to recommendations to manage stress in more so in the work environment if you develop a way to address stress in the workplace and money and Leadership by and was not an issue that looked dead say that again so if you could develop a way to address stress and inflates and money wasn't an issue the leadership bought into it off what might that look like if you knew it wouldn't
Participant:  fit if I knew it could you're just kind of breaking up that's why
Interviewer:  I'm sorry if you knew it couldn't fail if whenever you would recommend or you know managing stress for everyone off like what would be a good strategy but there is no problem with money and Leadership bought into it
Participant:  the only thing I find that works there helps me is communicate a lot with the contractors just making sure everybody's got the
Interviewer:  latest information that they
Participant:  need and everybody knows
Interviewer:  that knows my expectations it tends to be pretty smooth but if you
Participant:  don't communicate you just expect
Interviewer:  them to know everything then see where my stress would go up and
Participant:  because things aren't getting
Interviewer:  done but cuz I communicate things with
Participant:  project managers and sometimes that doesn't get transferred down to workers so as long as I'm doing my job communicating with everybody I feel like should be pretty stress-free
Interviewer:  any other any other thoughts 10 well Greg I appreciate your time today and thank you for taking some kind of well thank you very much
Participant:  all right. Have a good day you too
