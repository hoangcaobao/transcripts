Interviewer:  and it's the zoo yeah same so as I said what makes you feel valued and or supported at
Participant:  work I would say probably a verbal confirmation and what I'm doing is down the number one thing I would say but then I really think verbal confirmation is probably the biggest thing and that's kind of hard to find in a lot of the construction realm there's a lot of guys that don't like to say you're doing a good job because then that means they become a little bit vulnerable I believe and maybe that's more with the older set of construction workers I think the younger that we are and maybe a little bit closer to my age everyone else is like typically a more observant of the other person and they're more apt to give some confirmation of some sort saying yeah you're doing a good job or whatever
Interviewer:  right what parts of your work cause you stress so this is looking at what's challenging about your internet so what parts of your work cause you stress
Participant:  probably getting some tests that I may not know but I might be required to know June 3rd times that like because because we're General Contractors we kind of do a little bit of everything off and sometimes that everything isn't in my scope of what I've learned in the past so that that can then become stressful I'm trying to do something in a certain time frame that I don't necessarily know how to do that can become really
Interviewer:  stressful do you have any examples
Participant:  I'll give a pretty generic example say I was putting in door hardware for a a door that needed as a panic bar on it and it has different type of wiring that goes through the top of the door and then all the way through the bottom and it's Hardware that's brand new something that's new and off and it's supposed to be better than old stuff trying to figure that out even without instructions because sometimes Hardware will come without instructions trying to figure that out and making sure that it is all working properly in you know the the time frame that is typically given which is surrounded half an hour to get that done so getting done in that time maybe without the instruction can become pretty
Interviewer:  stressful make sense so the next is about stress and coping and would you say that lately you've been feeling stressed I don't think you're feeling stressed now but
Participant:  but lately I would say yes but that's only because I have a newborn and that's been that's been a fun little project all by itself off at work Ville I think there are times that I feel stressed especially since we go from we don't necessarily have a specific team that we work with we need from working with a certain Foreman to Jumping to a different job that a different form is on and the the different ways that each of those people work are not necessarily known especially since I'm a little bit newer in the company so having having to try to figure out each type of person as you go to each different job and like the the nuances of each job I guess some jobs are a little bit more like laid-back like it's not that big of a deal let's just get the job done right and then other jobs are let's get the job done as fast as possible and even though we're still be right it needs to be done quickly and fast and efficiently so it can it can be a little bit stressful in
Interviewer:  that sense and then you have a new boring
Participant:  and then I have a newborn on top of it yes or sleeping through the night no no she's not she is back up probably every three hours or so
Interviewer:  oh yeah and that's not on top of it yes yes sleep what do you currently do to manage whether it's stress at home even just with the transition having a newborn or stress at work off like like you're coping strategies for or just how you managed whether it's physically and
Participant:  mentally probably not the greatest I would say when I get the chance I probably play way too many video games definitely the Xbox is one of my coping mechanisms I'm not I don't go lean toward like any alcohol to cope which is probably a good thing in fact it's one of those things that like I've always tried to keep away from if I'm if I'm trying to cope if I'm having fun that's a completely different story but just the pope that's not something I would lean toward them physically I don't do much I should probably exercise more and that's something that I wanted to do but then there's more history behind that for like medical issues I have a heart disease which they say not to exercise as much because it could it could cause a problem so there's like there's the little bit of give-and-take there so as for physical sometimes I go for a walk to help cope most of the time I kind of bottle it up and that's that's kind of where I'm at with
Interviewer:  that might be even more detrimental to occur react disease you
Participant:  know I know I know and that's actually something that my primary care off I have just recently talked about starting to take some medication for some of that so we'll be getting on getting hopefully on a better speeds here right now but
Interviewer:  and then vacation is a coping
Participant:  vacation is definitely a coping this is been a wonderful opportunity my mother-in-law has a condo in Florida so every year we try to do at least make it make it down to this place once but
Interviewer:  so if you could develop a way to address stress in the workplace wage and money and Leadership by in was not an issue what would it look like
Participant:  that is a great question what would I to sorry my my nieces are right behind me to help greet to help stop with stress is that what you're asking sorry I sign
Interviewer:  distracted yes I was just distracted it was small voices like to address stress in the workplace if there was not not one single barrier leadership bought into it money wasn't an issue what might that look like you know it was there was it would be successful there would be no you know it wouldn't fail at all what would it
Participant:  look like we get a lot of things I definitely think some sort of I know I know that construction is hard on your body I think having the opportunity to have some kind of like wage paid for massage type thing I know that that would help a lot of guys and I don't know if it would be something that would be interested in at all but I think if I was able to get like a chiropractor visits or something along those lines where I know that it's already paid for I don't have to even think about like going and like dead physically getting my body taken care of and probably that goes into Healthcare itself like the by knew that everything was taken care of I probably would do it more than if I was to he's not if I know I have to pay for it it's already tight monetarily I think having the help end in Rockford does a really good job it just isn't perfect so I mean they they definitely give almost I think it's if you're a single person most of your health care is free it needs 80% is great so it's just amazing in comparison to a lot of other places but still think there could potentially be more like if yeah it's the money was out of question I would probably be able to take care of myself a little better
Interviewer:  more maybe a preventative help rather than you know waiting for somebody to get ill yes yes absolutely preventative help would be key can you think of anything
Participant:  else I mean money would always
Interviewer:  help
Participant:  but for I don't know maybe more vacation time opportunities to advance I think is another thing I know that there's they have that they already certain way of doing things so having an opportunity to advance a little bit more would be something that I could see as a stress
Interviewer:  reliever that is the end of my questions you have anything to add nope I don't have anything I think everybody's getting up now
Participant:  yeah
Interviewer:  I appreciate your time this morning and I hope you enjoy the rest of your vacation I definitely will thank you realize well thank you thank you everyone you too bye-bye bye-bye
