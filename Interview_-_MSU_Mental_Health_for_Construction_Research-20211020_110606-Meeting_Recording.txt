Interviewer:  plates to the positive aspects of your work environment so what makes you feel valued and or supported at work well I
Participant:  so I don't I don't think value or the that thing I mean I get the joy out of doing what I do I've been doing this for a long time and I just I like to be able to see the product in the in the field come to life and I mean that's just you take a set of drums and ideas from people and you make it a reality and to me that's that's kind of Halls the validation that I need is to get the end product I'm not looking for for compliments or you know pets on the back kind of thing it's just that's not why I do it so I don't know if that answers your question or not
Interviewer:  yeah the joy that you get from work or is really it can be anything and it can be in everybody is answered differently so there's really not a wait or wrong answer is really about just the the positive aspects of your work environment and you know the the outcome of it yep I
Participant:  mean the other stuff that's nice I mean I've done I've done some projects that have gotten news articles written about the one design and build Awards and those type of things that's kind of ancillary to you know it's nice to get those but that's not why I do it
Interviewer:  off and you've been doing this quite a while thirty-eight years now and
Participant:  actually I've been running work for almost in one form or another for 32 of it thirty three yeah so
Interviewer:  that's that's a long career yeah and I still got almost ten years to go over ten years to go before I retire what about what are some aspects that make the work environment challenging well
Participant:  one of the things that I've had throughout and and I do it on purpose is I don't get stuck in a certain Niche within the construction so if you look at my resume I've done schools I've done University work I've done a lot of industrial from wastewater treatment plants to car manufacturing food manufacturing place and historic reservations for taking warehouses and turning them into apartments and done some medical stuff so it's it's always something new new designs different different challenges so I'm a lot of people in our industry they get stuck in certain on disciplines so we've got a group that does my Renovations we've got a group that does Meijer new belts and they're probably great at it but you know it's basically the same problems and issues and changes over and over again I like the variety and getting new issues new challenges and and really stretching my my abilities you know I'm supposed so it's not just oh yeah this is what we did before kind of kind of thing it's it's always something new and exciting and challenging so
Interviewer:  okay so I'm challenging sounds like it's a positive thing for you things that are
Participant:  ya if ya I I get bored and lazy if I'm not
Interviewer:  challenged I hear you at the age what would you say in your work environment or your work life career causes you stress it's
Participant:  just well first and foremost
Interviewer:  did I freeze your did you
Participant:  well you're Frozen it might be my internet connection
Interviewer:  here my video off just down to see if that would help the bandwidth yeah I can hear you
Participant:  fine but yeah I don't know if you can still see me or not I I
Interviewer:  I can so the last
Participant:  thing you said was first and foremost first and foremost I've got a different type of personality I don't get stressed over a lot of things I'm very even-keeled I had got a boss one time that project that I was on and I had a very volatile owners route and he would yell and scream at me and I wouldn't get excited back at him and he wasn't used to that and he talked to my boss about it and he says well you gotta get used to Jon he is one of the calmest person's thoughts ever meet and it literally if the building was falling down around everybody I'd want to be standing next to him because he would be the calmest guy in the room and he would get me out so I don't get stressed a lot I don't I don't obviously there's there's things that you know tick you off that you know people make the same repetitive mistakes over and over again and despite your best efforts to steer them in the right direction they go off on their own Direction and it's like yeah I don't want to say I told you so but yeah you have to tell them I told you so so but you know it just costs them money not me so but yeah I really don't get stressed out over a lot of stuff
Interviewer:  is it because you have a really good routine where you're able to balance things
Participant:  well I think it's just inherent in my personality it's been that way so you know I you know I've worked for different Foreman supervisor and I mean they yell and scream at everybody and you never know when you really do anything wrong and I'm not saying I don't yell and scream at people but when I do they know I'm serious and that they've really screwed up I just like to you know talk and reason through things with with everybody and and that's just my way that works for me so long if you
Interviewer:  did let's I mean is the last however many 30 to 38 years have you done anything that's sort of helped you manage sort of keep things balanced in your life physically and
Participant:  mentally no I mean basically I mean I've got one Mantra I don't take my my home problems to work and I don't take my work problems home I mean, it's and it's not saying I don't talk to my wife about you know having a bad day or whatever and and but I try to try to keep my my work life in my personal life separate in also you know my my mental disposition the same way and not try to let let my paperwork get affected by my personal life so and sometimes it's not easy twenty years ago my dad committed suicide and I had to deal with that off for quite a while at work but I did my best to work through that sign
Interviewer:  yeah
Participant:  it's you know it's unfortunate he was wasn't even dead 60 years old yet so yeah so the top one there was yeah it's it's I can still remember the day I got the phone call like it was yesterday so but
Interviewer:  was he quiet sort of even-keeled guy like you know
Participant:  he wore his emotions on his sleeve yeah the only thing he just didn't do is he never let us he kind of hit his personal demons from us we had no idea I mean he wasn't seeing a psychologist or something and he had talked to his doctor about it and the doctor had put him on Paxil he didn't like the side effects of Paxil so he quit taking it without letting his doctor no choice so part of that is you know we had a lawyer contact us and said yeah yeah apparently they knew that there was suicidal side effects and they weren't telling people if you went off full. So wanted us to join a lawsuit and it's like now it's not going to bring him back we don't we don't need the money it's yeah so no we you know but now hey now he was yeah he trusts me he would yell and scream at us and and and all that and definitely let us know that that page where we stood you know from a fiery standpoint so no I'm more like my my grandfather on my mom's side everybody says I'm just just a version that's forty-five young years younger than he was dead personality-wise
Interviewer:  well it sounds good it sounds like your grandfather is he still alive
Participant:  no no he's he's been going bird thirty years
Interviewer:  so well you know we all end up with different dispositions yeah yours is carried you through quite a while and your career yeah it's been officially I think because based on the research and what we know about the overall effects of the pandemic and how it is not just with those who've gotten ill or those who are front-line workers but things that have been going on impacted in every occupation and was curious if you could develop a way to address stress in the workplace and and maybe not with those at your supervisory level but just in general and if leadership by an existed if money wasn't an issue you know you couldn't fail what was that look like sponges
Participant:  I I really don't know because you know that's a tough question for me to answer when you don't get stressed you know I mean there's lots of things I know I need help with as far as operating certain computer programs and those and I can answer those questions. This is what we need to do better but when you have when you when you don't have a problem that's inherent to you it's kind of hard for them I don't think I really do anything to manage my stress other than like I said trying to separate work and personal issues wage I mean I can't really say you know I don't have I don't have anything that I used to you know call me down I don't have asked you know I know people have said balls and those things to squeeze when they get stressed and those type of things so yeah I mean I honestly I mean I you know just having people having the ability I do get stressed to have some sort of Outlet whatever that may be and everybody's you know different for their stress levels and what their Outlet maybe some of them maybe I just need to walk away from the job for you know 15 20 minutes I need to call my you know supervisor and vent tool so just I think that's the biggest thing that I could say to help people is that they have to be identifying stress being able to know what negative impacts wage our our causing us and what what they need to do to manage their their triggers and their their release I mean that's I mean that's yeah. So how that actually gets turned into management buying into a and developing a plan in paying for it I have
Interviewer:  no idea well just boot Prasad drink any other thoughts recommendations any questions that you might have for
Participant:  me off no not really I mean you know you know early on in my career when when I first started running working and it was a one of those bad days people didn't show up found out there was issues in this in at the time I was working for a smaller company and the owner of the company was actually my boss and he goes
Interviewer:  yeah yeah how's it going and I just you know just kind
Participant:  of let him know nobody's showing up when they're supposed to know but he's doing what they're supposed to do they're not doing it off supposed to
Interviewer:  blow and and
Participant:  he was on the phone and he goes you know John he said if everybody did what they were supposed to when they were supposed to and how they were supposed to I would need supervision there they could all do it themselves and you basically would be out of a job and it kind of put things into perspective for me there it's like yeah I mean if things don't go
Interviewer:  bad and people don't need
Participant:  direction or correction I really wouldn't have the position that I have now so you know that's just one of those other life lessons you kind of take forward with you that yeah you know you're going to have good days you're going to have bad days and you just gotta I gotta say balance as you go through it
Interviewer:  sounds like you've developed or you've taken a lot of these life lessons and move them forward with you yeah right well I appreciate your time I know your time is valuable and I really do thank you for participating in this research study that MSU no problem good luck to you thank you very much.
