Interviewer:  Patrick nurse practitioner I'm here as a researcher and I'm going to ask you some questions just a few it just to get an idea of the work environment and the first question has to do with positive aspects about your work environment so if you could tell me what makes you feel valued and or supported at work what that starts out with really good questions
Participant:  huh there's no beating around the bush no taken I'm going to answer it like like I understood the question and the question was what do I enjoy about the job I think it is it's kind of what you're after is that correct
Interviewer:  okay what you enjoy what about your job that makes you feel like you're appreciate it for what you do but like that's you know the things that make you want to come in every
Participant:  day okay I have been doing this for twenty-five years I feel like I'm very good at what I do I like to face the challenges on a daily basis and overcome them with new Solutions wage I think I'm very knowledgeable in the aspect of making things work so
Interviewer:  twenty-five years you've got a lot of knowledge and expertise is there anything outside of what you bring and the confidence you have about your work environment that that would feel even more you know it's more enjoyable to come
Participant:  in I get along with the guys utilize their expertise and I think that by working together off we overcome issues and problems I befriend most everybody that's on site so it does make coming in
Interviewer:  enjoyable good thank you and there's really like there's really no right or wrong answers so I appreciate really anything you you feel like sharing and and again this is sort of and Beyond what some of the questions you answered on that survey you talked about enjoying the challenges what are some of the challenging aspect of your work
Participant:  environment challenging let's see over the years blueprints have become very vague schedules would become very tight and the challenges occur with how the design is not properly not properly transmitted out into the field and a rapid decision is made if you're going to have 15 to 25 guys standing around not being able to work getting farther that would be one of the best ways that could describe a daily challenge that we face is is the constant we need to a superintendent I have to manage today but look ahead 3 weeks from now so I can keep guys going all the time and stay that far ahead of it off so a project in general whether it's a tenant Improvement or a new-build is always on my mind I know a lot of guys that were a lot of people family members relatives that they can they can shut it off at 3:00 a.m. and not think about it again until the next morning the position that the superintendent holes is it's on your mind all the time that phone could ring at 7:00 at night and find out that took a leak how do you how do you consent and how do you deal with that and how do you how do you build a rapport enough with the guys that if I have to call a plumbing trade or an electrician at 8:30 at night that they're likely to answer because we have that Rapport and it's not a denslow again so I guess that's that's one of the biggest challenges is not only managing project you have to manage the people you have to build relationships and and face those challenges every day 8 to maintain everything if that makes sense it does are there any parts of your work that cause you stress oh were you mean are there any parts of my work that don't cause stress what we do is a very stressful very stressful position I think it takes I think it takes a special person to be able to change adapt and overcome to all the challenges we face on not only on a daily basis but project to project I think there are a lot of times I bring the stress home with a g at the end of the day I can tell you when my wife says what do you want for dinner I really don't care cuz I have done making decisions I want somebody else when I get home make a decision when we go to eat or anything because of the decision-making throughout the day so yes stress on a daily daily basis is in a given I would have to
Interviewer:  say you know and as it relates to the challenges in the stress on a daily basis would you say that has increased over the last year it has
Participant:  it has with the challenges of I was talking to guys older than myself as a leader on the project you know I'm still basically a kid compared to the older guys that I was talking to and then somewhere I think it happened last week became the oldest person and now I'm talking to Foreman that are half my age and they don't have the experience that the the previous month guys head and then when covid-19 you have to be you have to play a parent site as far as also a supervisor so now if because it's your project you're walking around telling guys to put your mask back on or make sure you wash your hands it's so that in itself on top of the fact that schedules didn't change project the races didn't change but lose one game because he test positive and then the
Interviewer:  the
Participant:  quarantine for the other guys that had close contact even though they're not having symptoms you can lose a crew in a matter of hours and and that in itself has presented with great challenges and the last year
Interviewer:  yeah sounds like it you know just impacting everywhere yes so a lot of stress sounds like Mike yes what do you do to manage your stress like your how you feel wage we feel from the stress that might have been building up in in mentally how do you challenge you know how do you manage it
Participant:  being in the field for over 25 years it's kind of become a a normal for lack of a better term I what I enjoy when I get home typically there's a cold beer and some TV and some down time there's always times to unwind off relax and watch the day off of you knowing that that day could start anytime you always in the back of your mind your phone is within at least hearing distance cuz if somebody calls you don't want to be the guy that just ignores them cuz it hit 5:00 or I don't want to be I should say weekends I stay busy I stayed active around the house house chores get up early continue to go man that's a tough question cuz you say it and are you asking my wife says it I don't feel stressed I think that it has become a norm not feeling of just keeping the project on your mind all the time I guess in the in undefined level in my head is not stress it's normal but for the average Layman yes that would be very stressful to not ever be able to turn your job off I guess but I don't look at it like that
Interviewer:  so it doesn't sound like you turn your job off
Participant:  no absolutely not
Interviewer:  so it stays with you and and you do stay busy in that maybe is a good way of keeping keeping sort of the momentum but you do you feel like you've had a moment to to relax to just sort of nap be present in the moment and not think about what didn't get done or what you have to do
Participant:  he said there was a a brief moment I was doing some work out west had been out there it's a vessel out there that that I knew was stressful there was a brief moment where I was at the Four Corners and I got to stay in Colorado and there was one evening I bought a a CBD soccer and I was in the hotel room I was all by myself and I I sat in there and hate the sucker out of curiosity a lot and shortly thereafter I knew that that my world had went from every project that I was running out there to being alive in that hotel room and nothing else it was the weirdest feeling because I guess if you say living in the moment that was the closest I've come in a long time I didn't think about tomorrow I didn't think about next hour I just thought about me right now in that room with the movie I was watching and I don't remember what that was and the Pizza Pub so I don't know that there's ever there's ever a time where
Interviewer:  I
Participant:  don't think about anything it's like I said earlier you're always with with the guys there you're always managing today but you're looking three weeks ahead and I do thank in my personal life and everything nothing not very spontaneous I have to have it planned I have two and if it is spontaneous it turns into if we decide right now that we're going to go to a movie instantly I'm deciding which movie which theater which route what do I got to get done before we leave everything becomes a mini project within the day I guess yeah so no I can't say that there's a time I live in the moment if I sit in the woods and and I'm hunting or anything like that you even though it's quiet it's green and you're still thinking about tomorrow you're still thinking about problem solving as you're waiting so long the the quieter the atmosphere the more your head works the louder the atmosphere the more you're able to live in a moment but not dead man good question yeah I don't think there is a a time that I can just let go and not think about anything I'm always worried about something
Interviewer:  do you feel that that constant preparation and planning gives you a higher stress level than maybe you had 25 years ago
Participant:  no actually I think I think it gives me less of a stress that issue because I think when it first got into to this part of construction it happened by accident and I didn't really understand what a superintendent was until the project started tanking once it starts tanking and you realize the the two things you can do is either take control of the situation or you can point your finger and blame everybody around you and it's because he didn't do his job and she didn't do her job and not because of that you guys are yelling at me when I realized that it's my job to make sure that nobody else gets yelled at but everybody else is on track that's what started the whole planning and originally it was probably planning a week ahead or a couple of days ahead and now I've come to master that I can tell you where my project should be three weeks from today and I doubt that too many of the younger superintendents can do that but I know that goal that I'm aiming for how long before I know where I should be at the end of today and the end of tomorrow and in three weeks if I'm not there I've got to adjust next week to know how I'm going to get their money yes it it was more stressful to me it was more stressful when I first got into it then now
Interviewer:  and it sounds like you really develop the expertise of a project planning and I think so yeah and it's a skill that that is wrong developed and it sounds like you've developed that well thank you because as you said the more you're it sounds like the more you planned and have deliberate milestones and if you don't make those you make adjustments wage that actually reduces your stress
Participant:  yes I would say that cuz I don't feel on a daily basis I don't feel like I come home stressed however I do know that I would not do do very well in a project that was five miles from the house currently live 50 miles to my nearest project typically that 50 miles coming home at night helps me unwind and off and start to relax if that makes sense it's not that it's not that I leave the job just all tense and tight but it helps me turn it off and know that I've reached an end of the day before I get home right I'd rather pass somebody coming to my city to work on a project that's three miles from my house go fifty miles to work on a project
Interviewer:  sure sounds like you need the last question time
Participant:  yes that's the exact word I was looking for that that's when I do decompresses the drive home
Interviewer:  at night that's that's that's really good insight into what you need to then by the time you get home know that you can enjoy being at home
Participant:  yes yes there is a relationship between
Interviewer:  if if I leave a
Participant:  project and end up on a call of some sort related to the project when I get home I walk in I believe with a different attitude or a different mindset so to speak that I don't realize what my wife does and she's the one telling me to relax and take a breath when I'm still wound up I didn't get to decompress so I'm using her to help decompress probably on some mental that I'm unaware
Interviewer:  of right unless she's probably has the ability to sort of mirror be able to see and and help you in a way to identify maybe how you're how you're doing is
Participant:  five years my little psychiatrist
Interviewer:  if you could so here's one last question as it relates to recommendations now I'm hoping to be able to provide some recommendations in a work environment such as yours to manage stress if you can develop a way to address say overall stress in the workplace and if money and Leadership they're buying wasn't an option like you had enough funds the the leadership bought into it you knew it couldn't fail what would it look
Participant:  like in if if finances and times were of the essence it would be that every project had a slightly bigger team and we price and allow for some if you can my day along with my teammates day is inundated with computer work quality control and pre-planning wage to where there's very very little time to even consider lunch a lot of our guys you to skip lunch or eat at their desk and they do that because we have contractors that
Interviewer:  you know
Participant:  throughout the day if we start at 7:00 we'll have guys that come in at 6:30 we'll have guys that come in at 8:00 we have guys that take lunch at 11:15 we have guys at 11:30 at noon so there's always somebody working on the project which makes it very difficult for you to have it defined lunch time because somebody might have an issue if you're off-site so we eat at our desks we problem solve from the time we open our eyes until everybody's off site and the projects locked out our team was a little bit bigger we could we could develop stronger camaraderie by two or three guys going to lunch the same time and unwinding or having a reset button midday and a few more team members on site would allow you a little time to have to yourself or with completely caught up cuz I don't think there's very many months for the tenants that are always completely caught up there's always something that could happen where if you had more team members you could actually enjoy the fruits of your labor and actually step back watch what's going on I think would be the best everything's about the projects in it it
Interviewer:  is but you know but you know Staffing and I look at it from that perspective I would say you know in a lot of different occupations that's that's a pretty important component and you know I think of it sounds similar to like on a hospital floor wage if you don't have enough people you're you're doing more with less and you don't get the month brakes or the dinner break and that does impact how much employees feel like being there or how they feel like the company values them I think that's I think
Participant:  that's right on I the guys I've worked with that take a defined lunch and say I'm going on lunch no matter what and I'm taking my half hour and it seemed like I'm shutting my phone off are basically burned out they they're done with it it's it has no longer become a career it's become a job and they just they're there and that's it.
Interviewer:  well that is a great recommendation and is there anything else like that you want to add,
Participant:  or I think you got I think you could almost run a
Interviewer:  project now you know there's a lot of things that I actually run a program so I'm perfect instead of understand I do a lot of work oh
Participant:  I'm sure you do
Interviewer:  well I sure do thank you for your time and your perspective and you know I it sounds like you've got a a really good process in place but I think it's taking you you know this time in your career to feel like you're in you know you are an expert you said you do have that experience in the skills behind you to have developed a good a good system that works and you know as long as you have that going and it's continuing to provide you in a way with that balance that you need to maintain being healthy that's great what's your appreciate that so again thank you for your time Mike and I hope you have a great day thank
Participant:  you ma'am you do
Interviewer:  thank you bye-bye
